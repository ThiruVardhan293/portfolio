<h1> The Best Movies According To ME </h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bahubali</h3>
<p>This movie has set a benchmark for many or the Indian directors who make movies with high budgets like the RAONE and
    Dhoom 3.
    <br /> I've never seen such an awesome war scene ever in any of the Hollywood movies even. <br />
    That scene is a treat for our eyes and our mind.

<h3>Tumbad</h3>
<p>Tumbbad's story is also unique. It's more than just a horror film with jump scares.
    <br />Instead, it focuses on human nature, societies, casteist norms and much more.

<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>Really beautiful movie</p>
